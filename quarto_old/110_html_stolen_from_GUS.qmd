# What is cipheR and why?

```{r}
#| echo: false
```

-   [`cipheR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cipheR/index.html) is a package for simple text ciphers.
    -   A cipher is text that has been transformed by some method with the intention of hiding its meaning
-   I made it because I needed a flexible [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

To install from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("cipheR")
```

# What I'm hoping you learn

-   Some cool new text ciphers perfect for passing notes in class
-   Base R methods to deal with text
-   Writing speedy code with `apply`

# What I'm hoping to get feedback on

-   Error handling (and if we have time, testing)
-   UX and how best to work with vector inputs
-   What kinds of code comments people expect in open source
-   Any spots where I can swap an `apply` for vectorization

# Caesar Cipher

-   Description: This can be used to create (encrypt) and solve (decrypt) a Caesar cipher. The function does not differentiate between the two.
-   Differentiator: You can choose your dictionary to shift by.



## Parameters {.smaller}

-   `x` A vector to be shifted
-   `n` The number of places to shift by. This can be either positive or negative. Zero returns x as it was given to the function.
-   `preserve_spaces` (Default: `TRUE`) A boolean describing if spaces should be preserved. This is helpful when working with sentences.
-   `dict` The dictionary used for shifting. This defaults to NULL in which case a dictionary is built from the sorted unique values of `x`.
-   `preset` A pre-made dictionary using ASCII codes from [ascii-code.com](https://www.ascii-code.com/). Note that `delete` is excluded as a character.
  - The options are to only use provided characters (`NULL`), `alphanumeric`, `keyboard`, `letters`, `lowercase`, `uppercase`. Characters are US English.
