I‚Äôve always loved asking ‚Äòhow?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô Since starting my journey as a data scientist, I‚Äôve been able to answer ‚Äòhow?‚Äô by architecting long-term reporting solutions and developing tools to support my teammates, while answering ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô with analyses to support data driven decision making. I‚Äôm looking for a position where I can put my skills to the test and help answer my two favorite questions.
