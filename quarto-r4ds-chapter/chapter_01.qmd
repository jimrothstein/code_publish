We have data about \`r nrow(diamonds)\` diamonds.

Only \`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)\` are larger than 2.5 carats.

The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

ggplot(aes(x = carat)) +

It contains three important types of content:

An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s.

Chunks of R code surrounded by \`\`\`.

Text mixed with simple text formatting like \# heading and \_italics\_.

Figure 28.1 shows a .qmd document in RStudio with notebook interface where code and output are interleaved. You can run each code chunk by clicking the Run icon (it looks like a play button at the top of the chunk), or by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter. RStudio executes the code and displays the results inline with the code.
