<p>“‘ Exercise 2.1 (Comparing the prior and posterior) For each scenario
below, you’re given a pair of events, A and B. Explain what you believe
to be the relationship between the posterior and prior probabilities of
B: P(B|A)&gt;P(B) or P(B|A)&lt;P(B) .</p>
<p>A (a) A = you just finished reading Lambda Literary Award-winning
author Nicole Dennis-Benn’s first novel, and you enjoyed it!</p>
<p>B = you will also enjoy Benn’s newest novel.</p>
<p>A = it’s 0 degrees Fahrenheit in Minnesota on a January day. B = it
will be 60 degrees tomorrow.</p>
<p>A = the authors only got 3 hours of sleep last night. B = the authors
make several typos in their writing today. A = your friend includes
three hashtags in their tweet. B = the tweet gets retweeted. “‘</p>
<p>We are told A, and asked to consider B: P(B | A) Prior is A. P(B | A)
= L(A | B)</p>
<p>(b) Prior is P(A) Posterior is P(B | A) Of all possible outcomes, B,
seems that P(B | A) is quite low.</p>
