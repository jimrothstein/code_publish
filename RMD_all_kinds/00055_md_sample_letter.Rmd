##Dear Dr Wong:##

Saw HIGH result (fecal test #2) and rec'd call from your office. Called back but long hold times this afternoon. Note: 1st fecal test is STILL reporting incorrectly.

Eager to proceed, but concern similar to those in fax i sent while back:

    -   diagnosis and confidence correct; that interventions will end hyperoxaluria.
    -   of course, want to know pro/con of proposed interventions.

Please do not be annoyed. I stuffed myself with fat for 6 days (coconut to eggs to avacado to ice cream - no potato chips). So much could not eat much on 7th or 8th day (have diet & rowing records to beginning of time ~2014). No diarrhea, on the contrary stool was "normal" and one was a swollen huge banana like pre-medications. Thought maybe some benefit to "keto" (high fat) diets.
What percentage of people with "pancrease insufficiency" have these symptoms?

thx.
