The above image was generated using `matplotlib` courtesy code provided by [Doing Math with Python](https://github.com/doingmathwithpython/code/blob/master/chapter2/Chapter2.ipynb) book.

Last month, I had an opportunity to conduct beginner Python workshop for maths department students in an arts and science college. It was a great experience and I had my first taste of how Python could be applied for mathematical problems. Presented here are bunch of useful links that I gathered as resources for the students.
