Hello!

I recently updated my book titled **Python re(gex)?** and it is free to download till 11-Aug-2019! You can still pay if you wish :)

![pyregex cover image]({{ '/images/books/pyregex.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

Get the ebook using either of these sites:

* [https://gumroad.com/l/py_regex](https://gumroad.com/l/py_regex)
* [https://leanpub.com/py_regex](https://leanpub.com/py_regex)

Code snippets, example files, sample chapters, etc are available on GitHub: [https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions](https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions)

This book covers both `re` module and the third-party [regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/) module. Examples are used extensively, please follow along by typing them out. Exercises are included to test your understanding and chapters have cheatsheets for easy reference.

**Table of Contents**

* Preface
* Why is it needed?
* Regular Expression modules
* Anchors
* Alternation and Grouping
* Escaping metacharacters
* Dot metacharacter and Quantifiers
* Working with matched portions
* Character class
* Groupings and backreferences
* Lookarounds
* Flags

* Miscellaneous
* Gotchas
* Further Reading

I plan to add more content to the book in future and hopefully create an interactive course. Currently the book is licensed under [cc-by-nc-sa](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) with code snippets under [MIT](https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions/blob/master/LICENSE) and I'll probably add the source files to the repo sometime in the future. I'm generating the PDF using [pandoc+xelatex](https://learnbyexample.github.io/tutorial/ebook-generation/customizing-pandoc). I plan to create an epub version too and possibly put the book on Amazon Kindle.

Hope you find the book useful. I would be grateful for your feedback and suggestions ([twitter](https://twitter.com/learn_byexample/status/1159676706224873472), [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47142552-python-re-gex)).

Happy learning :)
