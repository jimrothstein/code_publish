Exercise 2.1 (Comparing the prior and posterior) For each scenario below, you’re given a pair of events, A
and B. Explain what you believe to be the relationship between the posterior and prior probabilities of B: P(B|A)>P(B) or P(B|A)<P(B)
.

    A
(a)
A = you just finished reading Lambda Literary Award-winning author Nicole Dennis-Benn’s first novel, and you enjoyed it! 

B = you will also enjoy Benn’s newest novel.

A = it’s 0 degrees Fahrenheit in Minnesota on a January day. 
B = it will be 60 degrees tomorrow.

A
= the authors only got 3 hours of sleep last night. B
= the authors make several typos in their writing today.
A
= your friend includes three hashtags in their tweet. B = the tweet gets retweeted. 
```


We are told A, and asked to consider B:  P(B | A)
Prior is A.
P(B | A) =  L(A | B)


(b)
Prior is P(A)  Posterior is P(B | A)
Of all possible outcomes, B, seems that P(B | A) is quite low.
